## /Developer
At "Developer" folder, there is the "developer.html" file where you can find all the classes and id were used inside the website and the file/folder stracture of the project. For that I have used a local library that I have made for that purpose that get's into your html code and coppied all classes and Ids you have used so far, then it exports them as a JSON file and finally the Js file, responsible for the developer's field, fetches the JSON data and creates the lists that are displayed in the page.

\The file stracture feature needs to be fixed\

#### The library
You can find that library here : https://github.com/ptzakopoulos/My_Portfolio/tree/main/Developer
Note that this library was made only for the purposes of the assignment.
